I'm working on coding stubs, the concept of stub is becaming clearer, and the process of creation too. I'm trying to understand the glob patterns 
identifiyed by `output:` and create files with touch that will be recovered by the program mocking the real output files. I think that, maybe, tomorrow I'll end the 
stub creation process and wait for the reviews about my code.
